# Hand-off notes

For a new person or a new claude session picking this up cold. Read this, then the [project log](project-log/README.md) (decisions, lessons, journal), [README.md](README.md), [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [pvj/README.md](pvj/README.md).

## What this is

**nxlx.mastercontrol** by NXLX.Systems (Anthony Giglio, video artist; "NXLX" is his VJ name, now the whole practice). It is a fork of PocketVJ CP v3 by Marc-André Gasser (magdesign), whose upstream is unmaintained and unreachable. Goal: run on Raspberry Pi 3B/4/5, x86 mini PCs and old computers, on Pi OS Bookworm/Trixie and Debian/Ubuntu, and be rugged at gigs (direct Ethernet on a private network preferred).

The repository was renamed from `PocketVJ-CP-v3` to `nxlx.mastercontrol`.

## Decisions already made (do not reopen without a reason)

- Python 3, standard library only, replaces PHP. The legacy PHP and docs stay in the tree until feature parity.
- New code is Apache-2.0 (SPDX headers, `REUSE.toml`). Legacy code stays under the upstream `LICENSE.md`. `LICENSE.md` and `AUTHORS.md` are never edited. Copyright holder in headers: "NXLX.Systems and contributors".
- One long-lived mpv controlled over JSON IPC, supervised by systemd (`pvj-player.service`). The panel (`pvj-web.service`) is unprivileged; anything needing root goes through small helpers (`pvj-netd`, `pvj-sysd`, `pvj-supportd`) that answer only pvj-web over a socket.
- Token auth (PIN pairing, roles view/live/full), CSRF header, strict CSP. Signed updates with rollback.
- NDI and AES67/Dante are separate optional modules, not built yet. ST 2110 is not planned natively; it comes in through a gateway (D30). SRT/RTSP/RTMP streams, DMX, MIDI, the schedule and autostart are built, off by default.
- Naming: the `pvj` package, `pvj-*` services and commands and install paths keep their names.
- Style: no em dashes in written text (commas, semicolons, new sentences). Default document font Inter.

## Start here (next session, written 2026-10-01)

State at the end of 2026-10-01: master is green, **no open pull requests**, the test Pi 4 runs current master (0.1.0) with every service active.

Next, in the order the owner approved after the deep dive into the old manual:

1. **Factory reset, settings export and import, diagnostics** (a page or download with versions, health, logs). Needs no one at the box. Touches settings and root, so it gets an independent review.
2. Display mode (resolution and refresh, with confirm-or-revert) and display sleep/wake. **Needs the owner at the monitor**; ask first.
3. Mapper workflow: undo, number fields, export and import (including ofxPiMapper XML), switching saved mappings from the schedule, OSC, DMX and MIDI.
4. Wall: the server lists its clients, send a clip to clients, separate horizontal and vertical bezels.
5. Schedule with dates and intervals.
6. Follow-on actions and music under the slideshow.
7. Wi-Fi hotspot (large; needs the owner's go-ahead).

Small follow-ups: after `pvj-update rollback` from a terminal, the Updates card still says "Last update: updated to X" (the installed version line is right). Check after the Pi's next restart that `journalctl --list-boots` shows more than one boot (the persistent log, D35, was installed but not yet seen across a restart).

Owner's open items: a layout board at https://claude.ai/artifact/Bc24QHaMhyeS3eZfFyamLJ (press Save, then ask Claude to read it back) and editable mock-ups (SVG, layered PSD, PNG) in `docs/mockups/current/` (not in git; CI artifact `ui-mockups`). The design playground (D34, `tools/panel-playground`) has a preview at https://claude.ai/artifact/DYUr95vVi1jJyGquxhqZTu. A Pi 3B for two-box sync tests is waiting for a spare SD card (never touch its current card).

## What exists

Merged to `master`: the security hotfix, the platform layer, the installer and services, the image definition, and the new core in Python 3 (API, panel, modules, themes, OSC receive, signed updates with rollback). On top of that, each with its own notes:

| Feature | Notes | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Library: upload, rename, delete; play from a USB drive; copy a clip from USB to the box | `pvj/README.md`, `docs/MANUAL.md` | on |
| Playback: pads in banks, seek, skip, prev/next, play all, shuffle, end-of-clip, slideshow, audio files, fade in/out, freeze, blackout | `docs/MANUAL.md` | on |
| Mix: opacity, size, position, speed, volume, rotate, mirror, PNG overlay, transitions (cut, dip to black) | `docs/MANUAL.md` | on |
| Clip advice (what plays well on this board) | `pvj/probe.py` | on |
| Sound output, test tones | `docs/MANUAL.md` | on |
| Screen snapshot (on request; live view dropped, D20) | `docs/MANUAL.md` | on |
| PIN and the box's address drawn on the screen | `pvj/pinscreen.py` | on |
| Health card (power, temperature, helpers, addresses) | `pvj/health.py` | on |
| Updates card: signed bundles from USB or upload, rollback (D33) | `pvj/README.md` | on (needs a signing key) |
| Remote support over WireGuard, on request only | `docs/REMOTE-SUPPORT.md` | off |
| Old OSC command names | `pvj/OSC.md` | with OSC |
| Autostart (file, all, slideshow, pad, USB, preset) | `pvj/AUTOSTART.md` | off |
| Weekly schedule | `pvj/SCHEDULE.md` | off (beta) |
| Projectors (PJLink) | `pvj/PROJECTORS.md` | off (beta) |
| Projection mapper (quads, triangles, grids) | `pvj/MAPPER.md` | off (beta) |
| Multi-box sync and video wall | `pvj/SYNC.md` | off (beta) |
| Streams and live input (SRT, RTSP, RTMP, USB capture) | `pvj/STREAMS.md` | off (beta) |
| DMX (Art-Net, sACN), MIDI controllers | `pvj/DMX.md`, `pvj/MIDI.md` | off (beta) |
| Wired network settings with confirm-or-revert | `pvj/NETWORK.md` | off (beta) |
| System log kept across restarts, 64 MB cap (D35) | `docs/MANUAL.md` | on |

Docs for people: [docs/MANUAL.md](docs/MANUAL.md) and pictures in [docs/UI.md](docs/UI.md) (made by `tests/ui/screenshots.js`, which with `MOCKUPS` set also writes the editable mock-ups, `tests/ui/mockups.js`). Module manifests: `pvj/modules.d`.

## What has been run on real hardware, and what has not

One test Raspberry Pi 4 (Model B Rev 1.5, Debian 13 trixie, wired Ethernet, a 2560x1440 monitor, a USB drive, three USB MIDI controllers, a USB HDMI capture adapter) has run the CI image since 2026-09-30 and is kept on current master. **Verified there:** boot, panel and PIN pairing, uploads, playback (720p and 1080p H.264), HDMI sound, USB automount and playing from it, reboot and crash recovery, DMX over the LAN, the weekly schedule, autostart across reboot and crash, MIDI reading with all three controllers, the screen snapshot, the mapper's output (checked through screenshots; nobody watched the monitor), sync between two players on the box and against a stand-in server (within 5 ms after catching up), remote support against a stand-in hub, the health card, and a signed update through the Updates card followed by a rollback (2026-10-01). Details and numbers are in the journal.

**Not verified on hardware (do not claim it works):**
- Sync and the wall on two real boxes (waiting for the Pi 3B's spare card); a real support server (VPS); swapping USB sticks while running; copy from USB on the box.
- MIDI Learn with the real controllers; the PIN on screen on a fresh box; streams with a real source; HEVC, 4K, 1080p60; 24 fps judder; the second HDMI port; a real projector.
- The read-only root (`pvj-rootfs`), the Network module (test with a keyboard and monitor on the box, never over SSH on the only link), TouchOSC.
- Pi 3, Pi 5 and x86.

Not built: crossfade (needs a second player), display mode, factory reset, settings export and import, diagnostics, Wi-Fi and hotspot, updates from the network, NDI, AES67/Dante, presenter, importing old mapper files, MIDI controller profiles and feedback, custom DMX layouts.

Known limits: the panel cannot restart a wedged mpv (unprivileged by design). Merged branches on GitHub are not deleted (ask the owner). GitHub ruleset "Protect master" requires 9 checks and pull requests; do not change it without asking.

## Working on the test Pi

- SSH as `nxlx@nxlx-mastercontrol.local` (or 192.168.0.169). A session key is set up per session; ask the owner to `ssh-copy-id` a new one.
- `sudo` needs the owner's password, which is never written into the repo, memory or chat. When needed, the owner stages it on the Pi with `read -rsp "password: " p; printf '%s' "$p" > /tmp/.pw; chmod 600 /tmp/.pw; unset p; exit` (gone at reboot). Use it only as `S(){ cat /tmp/.pw | sudo -k -S -p "" "$@"; }`, never pipe data into an `S` command (see LESSONS), and delete `/tmp/.pw` when done.
- Deploy master: `git archive origin/master`, copy it over, run `install/install.sh --offline` as root. Settings have a schema number; never put older code on a box with newer settings.

## Testing

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` (about a minute; needs mpv).
- Browser test: `node tests/ui/panel.test.js` (needs Playwright and Chromium).
- On a real board: **Option C** in [tools/DEVICE-TESTING.md](tools/DEVICE-TESTING.md) (flash the CI image, then the numbered checklist). `tools/device-test.sh` and the manual "Device test" workflow are Options A and B. `tools/artnet-send.py` sends Art-Net to test DMX from a laptop.
- Static checks of the systemd units run everywhere (`tests/test_units.py`): the ordering-cycle bug that stopped the player at boot could not be seen in a container.
- Risky features got an independent read-only review; every finding was fixed with a test that reproduces it. Keep doing that for anything touching root, the network, uploads or auth.

## Working agreements

- Open a PR per finished branch. When it is green and ready, add a short comment and merge. Do not rewrite git history.
- Ask before destructive or outward actions (deleting remote branches, moving the repository, overwriting a card). Read the check list for failures before merging: zero failures, not just "nothing pending".
- Anything that reads devices, takes network input or handles filenames from removable media gets an independent read-only review before merging, and every finding gets a test.
- Report outcomes faithfully. Do not claim something works on hardware it has not run on.

## Lessons and limits

- The panel browser test once failed only in CI. The cause was real: the Network form kept typed values only through input events and lost one on a redraw; it now reads the page before every rebuild. When a UI test fails only in CI, add a diagnostic that prints the state at failure and rerun until it shows; do not merge over a red check and do not loosen the assertion.
- The first boot on real hardware found two service bugs no container test could (a systemd ordering cycle that dropped the player's start job, and mpv's owner-only control socket) and four Pi-specific defaults (cheap scaling, HDMI sound, USB media, the cost of a live preview). Read `project-log/LESSONS.md` before trusting a green CI run for anything that touches devices.
- A/B measure performance claims on the real device (A, B, A, B, A) and trust the person watching over a counter.
- A claude session in the cloud could not push tags or delete branches (HTTP 403 from the proxy). Do those from a normal clone or on github.com.
- The session's GitHub scope is fixed to the repo name it started with; after a rename, start new sessions on the new name.
- A claude cloud session cannot reach devices on your LAN. Use the self-hosted runner in DEVICE-TESTING.md or run the test script by hand.
