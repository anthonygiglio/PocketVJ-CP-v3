"""What is in a clip (codec, size, frame rate, length, sound), without playing it on the screen.

Replaces the old panel's "Movie Codec" and "Movie Resolution" buttons (mediainfo). mpv, which is already on the box,
opens the file with no video or audio output, decodes one frame and prints its properties; about half a second for a
clip on a Pi 4. Results are kept per file (path, size, modification time), so asking again is free.
