# Panel design playground

A working copy of the panel (Live, Mix, Media, System and the Updates card) with live controls for its look and layout. It is for trying ideas before changing `pvj/web/app.css` and `app.js`. It is a dev tool: it is not installed on the box and the panel does not depend on it (D34).

## What it does

- Shows the panel at phone, tablet, laptop or desktop size, or a phone next to a bigger screen. The wide layout follows the preview's width, not the browser window's (the 900px media query of `app.css` is a container query here).
- Changes the seven theme colours (`bg cd fg ln mu ac on`, starting from the four themes in `pvj/themes.d`), the typefaces, and about twenty sizes: text, border width, corner radius, padding, gaps, button, tab and pad heights, pad columns.
- Tries layout ideas that need `app.js` work: tabs at the top or in a side rail, a two-column Live screen, pads first, the Fade out, Freeze, Stop and Blackout row docked above the tabs, pad name placement, clip thumbnails.
- Shows each state of the Updates card (D33): nothing waiting, on a USB drive, uploaded, uploading, confirm, installing, done and failed. The progress bar and the confirm step drawn on the card are ideas; the panel shows text and uses the browser's confirm dialog today.
- **Export** gives only what was changed: CSS to append at the end of `pvj/web/app.css`, a theme file for `pvj/themes.d`, and the settings as JSON. Settings are kept in the browser's local storage.

The panel part is `src/Panel.tsx` and `src/panel.css`, which use the panel's own class names and default values. When `app.css` changes, update `panel.css` and the defaults in `src/settings.ts` to match, or the playground drifts from the real panel.

## Run and build

Needs Node 18 or newer.

```
cd tools/panel-playground
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173, reloads on save
npm run build      # type check, then one self-contained dist/index.html
```

`dist/index.html` has everything inlined (the Google Fonts it offers load from the network when online). Open it from disk or publish it as a page.
